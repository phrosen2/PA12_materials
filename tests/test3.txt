[Courtyard]

(bright sunshine and a feeling of a hot, slightly arid environment)
ELINE: Kamin, please come back inside.
(But Picard marches off to explore)

[Town square]

(from the cool shade of a colonnade, Picard watches a tree-planting ceremony)
BATAI: Thank you. This sapling is planted as an affirmation of life in defiance of the drought and with expectations of long life. Whatever comes, we will keep it alive as a symbol of our survival. Kamin! You're back on your feet! How do you feel, my friend?
PICARD: Are you in charge here?
BATAI: In charge?
PICARD: I want to be returned to my ship immediately.
BATAI: What ship is that?
PICARD: Please, just tell me, what is this place? Where am I?
BATAI: The fever. It's taken your memory.
PICARD: That must be it. Perhaps you can help me.
BATAI: Anything, my friend.
PICARD: My name is Kamin?
BATAI: Yes.
PICARD: And you are?
BATAI: Batai. Council leader Batai.
PICARD: Ah. Batai. And you say I've been ill?
BATAI: For more than a week. Eline should've put you in the hospital, but she insisted on caring for you herself.
PICARD: Eline?
BATAI: Your wife. If you don't remember that, maybe it's safer not to go home.
PICARD: And what is this place?
BATAI: Perhaps you should see the doctor.
PICARD: No, please, I'm sure it will all come back to me.
BATAI: This is the community of Ressik. Northern province.
PICARD: What planet?
BATAI: Let me take you back home.
PICARD: No, really, I'm quite all right. Just answer me. What planet?
BATAI: This is the planet Kataan.
PICARD: Kataan. Not a Federation planet. I think I'll just take a walk.
BATAI: But you've been ill for a week.
PICARD: The exercise will do me good. I'll try to re-acquaint myself with the surroundings.
(he goes up into the hills and looks down on the white-walled community perched on an outcrop above a very small river)

[Living room]

(its late when the doorbell chimes)
ELINE: Thank goodness. I've had people out trying to find you everywhere. Why did you worry us like that? Are you hungry?
PICARD: Hungry, thirsty, exhausted. I suppose that proves this is not a dream, doesn't it?
ELINE: You think this, your life, is a dream?
PICARD: This is not my life. I know that much.
ELINE: I've kept something hot for you. Where did you go?
PICARD: I walked. For hours.
ELINE: And you're just out of bed.
(she hands him a plate of soup)
PICARD: It's delicious.
ELINE: You always say that.
PICARD: Would you try to answer some questions for me, no matter how strange they may seem to you?
ELINE: Of course.
PICARD: Are there other planets in this star system? Do you visit other systems? All right. Do you have a communication system here? How do you send messages to other communities, to other places?
ELINE: The usual way, by voice-transit conductor. Do you want to send a message?
PICARD: Yes. When can that be arranged?
ELINE: Tomorrow. Don't you want to ask about us?
PICARD: Of course. Anything you can tell me will be helpful. We're, er, um, married?
ELINE: Three years ago. The happiest day of my life was the day we got married.
PICARD: And what do I do here in Ressik?
ELINE: You're the best iron weaver in the community. At least I think so. You prefer playing the flute, of course.
PICARD: The flute?
ELINE: Yes.
(she fetches him a penny whistle decorated with a tassel)
PICARD: And when did I learn to play it?
ELINE: I'm afraid you never did, dear, but you keep trying.
(he gives it a trial blow)
PICARD: I see what you mean. Well, thank you for the soup. Thank you for your help. Tomorrow, will you help me send a message?
ELINE: Of course. Will you come to bed?
PICARD: Oh, I'll sleep here.
ELINE: Kamin, please come with me.
PICARD: I've been sick. I'll be tossing and turning. It wouldn't be fair to you.
ELINE: Let me be the judge of that.
(as she leans forward he sees a pendant on a necklace - it is the same design as probe that the Enterprise encountered) PICARD: Where did you get this?
ELINE: Kamin, this is the first gift you ever gave me.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Riker to Sickbay. The Captain's hurt.
(Beverly is scanning Picard)
CRUSHER: Pulse and blood pressure are normal I'm getting hyperactive fibrogenic activity. This is odd.
RIKER: What is it?
CRUSHER: There's no evidence of any injury or trauma. Vital signs are normal, but neurotransmitter production is off the scale. What's going on?
RIKER: That probe is doing something to him. Anything yet, Data?
DATA: No, sir. The particle emission is most unusual. I am unable to block it.
WORF: We should destroy the probe. Phasers are armed and ready.
CRUSHER: I don't think that's wise. Not until we know exactly what it's doing to him.
RIKER: Agreed. Stand down phasers, Mister Worf. In the meantime, take us out of range. Ensign. Thrusters only, one hundred kph nice and easy
ENSIGN: Aye, sir.
RIKER: Data?
DATA: The probe is moving with us, sir, holding relative position.
CRUSHER: It's connected itself to him, like a tether.

[Courtyard]

ELINE: You've been dreaming of that starship of yours again, haven't you?
PICARD: I'm just charting progress of the course of the sun. It might give a clue to the cause of this drought.
ELINE: I think you're still trying to figure out where you are. Where that ship of yours is. How to get back to that life.
PICARD: The memory is five years old now, but it's still inside me.
ELINE: Was your life there so much better than this? So much more gratifying, so much more fulfilling, that you cling to it with such stubbornness?
PICARD: Eline.
ELINE: It must have been extraordinary. But never in all of the stories you've told me have you mentioned anyone who loved you as I do.
PICARD: It was real. It was as real as this is. And you can't expect me to forget a lifetime spent there.
ELINE: Yes, I can. I've been patient, Kamin. For five years I've shared you with that other life. I've listened, I've tried to understand, and I have waited. When do I get you back?
PICARD: I know. I know. It has been hard on you.
ELINE: When will you let go? When will you start living this life? When will we start a family?
BATAI: Kamin, Eline, good morning.
PICARD: Good morning, Batai.
BATAI: Are you ready? The Administrator's already arrived.
PICARD: Yes. Will you come along?
ELINE: No, thank you. You do very well on your own.
BATAI: She always was strong-minded, even when she was a child.
PICARD: It's not her fault. These past few years have been very difficult for her.
BATAI: And for you, I think.

[Town square]

ADMINISTRATOR: There you are, Batai. Perhaps you can explain to me, when crops are dying all over, how this tree is flourishing?
BATAI: This tree is our symbol, our affirmation of life. Everyone in this town gives part of their water rations to keep it alive. We've learned, Administrator, that hope is a powerful weapon against anything. Even drought.
ADMINISTRATOR: A good point. Perhaps I shall recommend a symbolic tree in each of my communities. Now. What business do we have today?
BATAI: We need help if we're to increase the water supply. We think there are ways to reclaim some of our water.
ADMINISTRATOR: Batai, you're being a bit of an alarmist. True, we are in a drought, but water rationing has produced a sizeable savings.
PICARD: If the weather pattern doesn't change, rationing will not be enough. We'll run out of water.
ADMINISTRATOR: Who is this?
BATAI: Kamin, sir.
ADMINISTRATOR: Kamin. Do I know you?
PICARD: No. I haven't spoken to you before.
ADMINISTRATOR: Well, Kamin, I'm open to all the people of this town. I'm delighted to hear what you have to say.
PICARD: I suggest that we build atmospheric condensers which could extract water from the air.
ADMINISTRATOR: I don't mean to quash your very creative ideas but building atmospheric condensers would be a monumental undertaking. We could not hope to sustain such a project.
PICARD: Each community would be responsible for its own. Condensers could make the difference between watering our crops or watching them die.
ADMINISTRATOR: Well, I'll be glad to pass along your idea. You'll see that this kind of participatory government works for everyone. Be well, Batai. I shall see you next month. Good to meet you, Kanin.
BATAI: Go carefully, Administrator.
(The Administrator leaves)
BATAI: That went very well. I think he was impressed with you.
PICARD: But there'll be no atmospheric condensers.
BATAI: These things take time, but it will happen. I'm sure of it.
PICARD: Come and have supper tonight, my friend. I'll make some vegetable stew. Let's talk about building our own condenser.
BATAI: Kamin. Hearing you talk to the Administrator, I realised that for the first time in years, you were speaking as though you were truly a member of the community. It was good to hear that again.
